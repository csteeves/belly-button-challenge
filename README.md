# belly-button-challenge

## Header:
This challenge is designed to show my ability in using the D3 library within JavaScript to extract, transform, and load data to an app. 

## Objectives:
(1.) Use the D3 library to read in samples.json

(2.) Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

(3.) Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

(4.) Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

(5.) Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

(6.) Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
